\title{Decide Variable Type (Iterative)}
\usage{
decide_variable_type_iterative(
  X,
  Y,
  minsplit = 5,
  direction = c("backward", "forward", "both"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame of predictors (no response).}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector (the response).}

\item{minsplit}{Minimum number of observations in a node to consider splitting. Default 5.}

\item{direction}{Stepwise strategy: "forward", "backward", or "both". Default is "backward".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A named list of decisions, where each element contains:
  \item{type}{Either "dummy" or "linear".}
  \item{cutoff}{The split value (if type == "dummy").}
}
\description{
A stepwise variable selection method that iteratively chooses each variable's best form
  (either "linear" or "dummy") based on model AIC improvement. Supports forward, backward,
  or both-direction stepwise logic.

  Dummy forms are created using a shallow (maxdepth = 2) rpart tree fit to the partial
  residuals from the current model. The best split is converted into a binary dummy.
