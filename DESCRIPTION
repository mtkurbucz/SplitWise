Description: Implements a hybrid regression approach that allows numeric variables
    to be transformed into either single-split (0/1) dummy variables or retained
    as continuous predictors. This transformation is followed by stepwise selection
    to identify the most significant variables. Additionally, the package offers
    an 'iterative' mode designed to detect partial synergies among variables,
    enhancing model performance.
