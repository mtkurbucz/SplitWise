Description: Implements 'SplitWise', a hybrid regression approach that transforms
    numeric variables into either single-split (0/1) dummy variables or retains
    them as continuous predictors. The transformation is followed by stepwise
    selection to identify the most relevant variables. The default 'iterative'
    mode adaptively explores partial synergies among variables to enhance model
    performance, while an alternative 'univariate' mode applies simpler
    transformations independently to each predictor. For details, see Kurbucz et al. (2025) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15423>.
